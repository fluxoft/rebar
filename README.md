## Rebar

Rebar is a lightweight, flexible PHP framework designed to give developers a solid **skeletal foundation** for their applications. Much like its namesake — reinforcing bars used to strengthen concrete — Rebar provides the essential structure around which developers can add their own **concrete implementations**.

Rebar is not meant to be all things to all people. Instead, it focuses on:
- **Simplicity**: No hidden magic or bloat. Clear, explicit code that’s easy to understand and extend.
- **Flexibility**: A minimal but extendable framework that lets you shape it to your needs.
- **Stability**: Providing a dependable core with tools to reinforce your application’s architecture.
