## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-13
### Deprecated
- `Controller::set()` has been deprecated. Use `$this->response->SetData()` instead.
- `Controller::Display()` has been deprecated. The router now directly invokes `$response->Send()` to handle rendering.
- These methods are excluded from test coverage and will be removed in version 1.3.0.

### Added
- Centralized response data management in the `Response` class with `SetData()`, `GetData()`, and `ClearData()`.
- Introduced `Response::SetPresenter()` for managing presenters directly on the response object.
- Enhanced `Response::Send()` to handle rendering and sending the response, replacing the need for `Controller::Display()`.

### Fixed
- Improved separation of concerns between controllers and response rendering logic.
