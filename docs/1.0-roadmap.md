# rebar 1.0 Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the key areas of focus for the 1.0 release of the rebar framework. Each section represents a major goal that will be addressed as part of this milestone.

## 1. Documentation
- **Goal**: Ensure clear and up-to-date documentation.
- **Approach**:
    - Use PHPDoc for in-code documentation.
    - Generate project documentation using Docusaurus or MkDocs.
    - Set up a workflow to keep documentation updated with code changes.

## 2. Db Component Overhaul
- **Goal**: Support multiple database engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL).
- **Approach**:
    - Implement PDO abstraction or integrate Doctrine DBAL.
    - Add support for multiple database engines with configurable connections.
    - Write tests for each database engine.

## 3. Caching Mechanism
- **Goal**: Introduce caching support for Redis/Memcached clusters.
- **Approach**:
    - Create a caching interface.
    - Add support for Redis and Memcached clusters.
    - Allow configurable caching policies (e.g., query TTL).
    - Ensure pluggability for future cache backends.

## 4. Routing & Bootstrap Improvements
- **Goal**: Simplify routing and setup process.
- **Approach**:
    - Develop a bootstrap service to set up the service container, routes, and middleware.
    - Add helper functions for common tasks (e.g., registering routes, configuring services).

## 5. Middleware Support
- **Goal**: Implement middleware to manage request lifecycle.
- **Approach**:
    - Add middleware pattern for modifying requests/responses before they reach controllers.
    - Implement core middleware for authentication, authorization, and validation.
