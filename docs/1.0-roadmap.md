# Rebar Framework 1.0 Roadmap

## 1.0 Release Goals
The following tasks will bring the Rebar framework to a solid 1.0 release, focusing on core functionality, test coverage, and usability:

1. **Refactor or Remove the Rest Module** (✓ Complete)  
   - Evaluate the merits and flaws of the `Rest` module.  
   - Refactor it into a more robust feature or remove it entirely if it doesn't align with the framework's goals.  
   - **Outcome**: The `Rest` module was refactored and achieved 100% test coverage for its `AbstractRestController` and `AbstractService`.

2. **Enhance the IoC Container** (✓ Complete)  
   - Revamp the `Container` module with improvements or possibly overhaul it entirely to ensure flexibility, reliability, and ease of use.

3. **Modernize the Config Module** (✓ Complete)  
   - Update the `Config` module to act as a central repository for configuration values:  
     - Support loading configuration from multiple sources, including:  
       - Environment variables  
       - `.env` files  
       - `.ini` files  
       - Combinations of these.  
     - Provide helper methods to streamline configuration access during application development.

4. **Revise Presenters** (✓ Complete)  
   - Move the `Presenters` into the `Http` module, as they are only used by `Http\Controller`.  
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for Presenters to ensure 100% coverage.

5. **Improve Routing and Bootstrap** (✓ Complete)  
   - Simplify routing and the setup process:  
     - Develop a bootstrap service to set up the service container, routes, and middleware.  
     - Add helper functions for common tasks (e.g., registering routes, configuring services).

6. **Middleware Support** (✓ Complete)  
   - Implement middleware to manage the request lifecycle:  
     - Add middleware patterns for modifying requests/responses before they reach controllers.  
     - Implement core middleware for authentication, authorization, and validation.

7. **Achieve Full Test Coverage for the Http Module** (✓ Complete)  
   - Write thorough unit tests for the `Http` module to ensure its stability and reliability.

8. **Achieve Full Test Coverage for the Data\Db Module** (✓ Complete)    
   - Cover the `Data\Db` module with complete unit tests, ensuring its core database functionality is well-tested.

9. **Documentation** (✓ Complete)    
   - Create a skeletal documentation set for the framework:  
     - Include basic usage guides.  
     - Answer common questions to help developers get started quickly.  
   - Use PHPDoc for in-code documentation.  
   - Generate project documentation using Docusaurus or MkDocs.  
   - Set up a workflow to keep documentation updated with code changes.
