# Rebar Framework 1.1 Ideas
This is just a big general wishlist that will be revised once I actually start work on 1.1

## Post-1.0 Enhancements
The following features and improvements are planned for the 1.1 release of the Rebar framework:

1. **Data\Caching Module**
   - Introduce a `Data\Caching` module to add object caching functionality to mappers.
   - Support integration with popular caching solutions like Redis and Memcached.
   - Allow configurable caching policies, such as query TTL.
   - Ensure pluggability for future cache backends.

2. **Command and Daemon Services**
   - Develop a set of services inspired by the Migrant package.
   - Enable users to create commands and daemons with ease.

3. **Application Scaffolding Commands**
   - Add scaffolding commands for applications:
     - Enable rapid application setup.
     - Lay the groundwork for a Composer project that provides a streamlined way to bootstrap applications using Rebar.

4. **Support for Additional Databases**
   - Expand database support to include SQLite, Oracle, and other engines based on demand.

5. **Advanced Query Features**
   - Add advanced query capabilities such as window functions and CTEs (Common Table Expressions).

6. **Validation Layer**
   - Create a robust validation system for incoming data, both at the HTTP level and in the Data\Db layer.

7. **Debugging and Performance Monitoring Tools**
   - Provide built-in tools for debugging and monitoring application performance.
   - Consider integration with popular profiling tools.

8. **Enhanced Middleware Features**
   - Add advanced middleware capabilities, such as:
     - Dynamic middleware chaining.
     - Error handling middleware.

9. **Authentication Enhancements**
   - Extend authentication mechanisms to support OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and SSO integrations.

10. **Testing Utilities**
    - Add utilities to simplify writing tests for Rebar applications, including mock generators and testing helpers.

11. **CORS Header Safety**
    - Revisit the handling of `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` to ensure a balance between security and flexibility.
    - Consider implementing a default whitelist of common headers and evaluate risks of allowing all headers.
