# Rebar Framework 1.x Roadmap

This document serves as a general wishlist and planning guide for the Rebar Framework's 1.x series. Items may move into specific version plans as priorities shift or features are developed.

## Wishlist for 1.x Series
The following ideas and enhancements are under consideration for future 1.x releases:

1. **Data\Caching Module**
   - Introduce a `Data\Caching` module to add object caching functionality to mappers.
   - Support integration with popular caching solutions like Redis and Memcached.
   - Allow configurable caching policies, such as query TTL.
   - Ensure pluggability for future cache backends.

2. **Command and Daemon Services**
   - Develop a set of services inspired by the Migrant package.
   - Enable users to create commands and daemons with ease.

3. **Application Scaffolding Commands**
   - Add scaffolding commands for applications:
     - Enable rapid application setup.
     - Lay the groundwork for a Composer project that provides a streamlined way to bootstrap applications using Rebar.

4. **Support for Additional Databases**
   - Expand database support to include SQLite, Oracle, and other engines based on demand.

5. **Advanced Query Features**
   - Add advanced query capabilities such as window functions and CTEs (Common Table Expressions).

6. **Validation Layer**
   - Create a robust validation system for incoming data, both at the HTTP level and in the `Data\Db` layer.

7. **Debugging and Performance Monitoring Tools**
   - Provide built-in tools for debugging and monitoring application performance.
   - Consider integration with popular profiling tools.

8. **Enhanced Middleware Features**
   - Add advanced middleware capabilities, such as:
     - Dynamic middleware chaining.
     - Error handling middleware.

9. **Authentication Enhancements**
   - Extend authentication mechanisms to support OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and SSO integrations.

10. **Testing Utilities**
    - Add utilities to simplify writing tests for Rebar applications, including mock generators and testing helpers.

11. **CORS Header Safety**
    - Revisit the handling of `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` to ensure a balance between security and flexibility.
    - Consider implementing a default whitelist of common headers and evaluate risks of allowing all headers.

12. **Swagger-Based Code Generation**
    - Implement a code generation feature that interprets Swagger/OpenAPI specifications to create boilerplate code for controllers, services, DTOs, and responses.
    - Include stubs that handle input validation and output formatting using Rebar's existing Models or DTOs.

13. **Enhanced DTO Support**
    - Provide first-class support for DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) in the framework.
    - Enable generation of request and response DTOs from Swagger specs, with examples of how to map them to Models in a service.

## Completed Features

### 1.0 (Released 2025-01-01)
- Refactored or removed the Rest module.
- Enhanced IoC Container for flexibility and ease of use.
- Modernized the Config module for multi-source configuration.
- Moved Presenters to the `Http` namespace and achieved full test coverage.
- Simplified routing and bootstrap setup.
- Implemented middleware support for the request lifecycle.
- Achieved full test coverage for the `Http` and `Data\Db` modules.
- Created basic documentation, with a workflow to keep it updated.

### 1.1 (Planned)
- **Presentation Enhancements**:
  - Refactor presenters and response handling.
  - Add default presenters for error and fallback responses.
  - Centralize rendering through the `Response` class.
  - Provide a fallback `default.phtml` template for `PhtmlPresenter`.
  - Update middleware and routing to support default presenter configuration for paths and content types.
